Get Started with Docker for Mac OS X
This is written for users of Mac OS X. If you are not using Mac OS X, see the Linux or Windows version.
This getting started is for non-technical users who are interested in learning about Docker.
By following this getting started, you’ll learn fundamental Docker features by performing some simple tasks. You’ll learn how to:

install Docker software using the Docker Toolbox
run a software image in a container
browse for an image on Docker Hub
create your own image and run it in a container
create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
create an image of your own
push your image to Docker Hub for others to use
The getting started was user tested to reduce the chance of users having problems. For the best chance of success, follow the steps as written the first time before exploring on your own. It takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.

Make sure you understand…
This getting started uses Docker Engine CLI commands entered on the command line of a terminal window.
You don’t need to be a wizard at the command line, but you should be familiar with how to open your favorite shell or terminal, and run basic commands in that environment. It helps (but isn’t required) to know how to navigate a directory tree, manipulate files, list running process, and so forth.
